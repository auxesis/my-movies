=== Movie Sample Data ===

This application relies on sample data provided by IMDB, which is
released under a license with restricts redistribution.

You can install the sample data using the steps described on this
website:

  http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/


=== Additional Social Features ===

Once IMDB data is installed, there are a couple of additional tables
which need to be created.  You can import a dump file from:

  ./lib/install.sql

This does not include fake users.  You can import these names from another file (under the GPL v3 license):

 ./lib/fakenames.sql

=== Configuration File ===

There are only a few settings to modify, and they should mostly make sense.
See:

 ./lib/config.inc.php.
